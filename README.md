Visual Retro System Emulator Builder

Design Document v0.2 document subject to change.

Project Overview
The Visual Retro System Emulator Builder is an educational tool that allows users to construct virtual
retro computer systems by visually placing and connecting components on a simulated PCB. Users can
select CPUs, memory chips, custom ICs, and other components from a library and connect them to
create functional emulations of classic computers.

Core Architecture

Application Layers
  1. UI Layer: PyQt-based interface for component placement and
  2. manipulation
  3. Component Model: Data structures representing hardware components
  4. Connection System: Manages links between components
  5. Simulation Engine: Coordinates component execution and timing
  6. Component Library: Collection of predefined hardware components

Component Model

Each hardware component will be represented by a class with:
     Visual representation (appearance on the board)
     Properties (configurable settings)
     Connection points (pins, buses)
     Behavioral implementation (how it functions)
     Timing characteristics

Component Types
     Processors: 6502, Z80, 68000, etc.
     Memory: RAM (static, dynamic), ROM
     Custom Chips: SID, VIC-II, Paula, etc.
     I/O Controllers: Serial, parallel, keyboard interfaces
     Clock Generators: System timing
   Buses: Address, data, and control connections
User Interface Design
Main Application Window
   Component palette on the left
   Simulated PCB canvas in the center
   Property editor on the right
   Menu bar and toolbars at the top
   Status and debugging area at the bottom

Canvas Interactions
   Drag and drop components from palette
   Connect pins by click-drag between components
   Resize and rotate components
   Pan and zoom the PCB view

Property Editor
   Edit component-specific properties
   Configure memory mapping
   Set clock speeds and timing parameters

Implementation Plan

   Wire visualization
   Bus implementation
   Signal propagation

Phase 3: Basic Components
    Implement CPU, RAM, ROM, Clock
    Simple I/O devices
    Basic system simulation

Phase 4: Emulation Engine
    Timing coordination
    Execution management
    Debug visualization
    State inspection

Phase 5: Advanced Components
    Custom chips (sound, graphics)
    Complex peripherals
    System templates (C64, ZX Spectrum, etc.)

Technical Implementation

Technology Stack
    Programming Language: Python 3.x
    UI Framework: PyQt6
    Graphics: Qt Graphics View Framework
    Saving/Loading: JSON or XML format
    Emulation Backends: Custom Python or integration with existing emulators

Development Environment
    Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac)
    Version control with Git
    Modular architecture for collaborative development
Initial Components to Implement

Processors
    MOS 6502 (Commodore 64, Apple II, NES)
    Zilog Z80 (ZX Spectrum, MSX)
    Motorola 68000 (Amiga, Atari ST)

Memory Components
    Generic RAM (configurable size)
    ROM (loadable from file)
    Memory mapped I/O

Support Chips
    Clock generator
    Address decoder
    Bus controller

Next Steps
 1. Create project skeleton
 2. Implement basic UI framework
 3. Design component base classes
